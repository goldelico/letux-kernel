Description of entries in featurelist.tsv
=========================================

A) Format

This is a Tab Separated Values file: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values

First Line are the column headers.

First value must be "Feature". The others are device/board names.

All other lines represent table contents.

B) First column is the feature name

It can contain records in the format [[Page]] which will be translated into
a link to the Letux Kernel Wiki page.

Example:

	[[USB]] -> http://projects.goldelico.com/p/gta04-kernel/page/USB/

C) other columns represent Feature Status

Values can be any string but several patterns are decoded and translated into a background color:

	Pattern		Color	Meaning
	linux		green	in Linux mainline (www.kernel.org) - works with default config
	linux-$$$	green	in Linux mainline (www.kernel.org) since v$$$ - works with default config
	letux		yellow	works in letux but not in mainline - needs letux_defconfig
	letux-$$$	yellow	works in letux-$$$ but not in mainline - needs letux_defconfig
	wip		orange	work-in-progress in LetuxOS but not working (well)
	nok		red	not yet supported (neither LetuxOS nor mainline)
	n/a		grey	Hardware does not provide this feature
	impossible	black	Seems impossible although hardware supports feature (e.g. lack of documentation, project, non-free code)
	unknown		white	Status is unknown

All other strings stand for themselves and are treated like the "unknown"

Each pattern can contains a "#issue" suffix creates a link to the issue with the
given number in the kernel project issue list. This is stripped of for display.

There are aliases and shortcut patterns which are displayed differently from what
is written in this table:

	Pattern		translated Pattern
	+		-> linux
	mainline	-> linux
	ok		-> linux
	v$$$		-> linux-v$$$
	l$$$		-> letux-$$$
	-		-> nok
	no		-> nok
	!		-> impossible
	?		-> unknown

The sequence of processing is
1. strip off #issue
2. translate aliases
3. determine color

Examples:

	l5.4-rc7	-> "letux-5.4-rc7" in yellow
	wip#849		-> "wip" in orange with link to http://projects.goldelico.com/p/gta04-kernel/issues/849/

Note: we have though about auto-detecting status from the issue list
but it is too complex to get good heuristics and would require to
list everything in the issues. Mapping to features/devices is also
non-trivial.
