# allow access to local X server

# since the X server is being started with varying DISPLAY name and
# different -auth parameter we have to grep the X command from ps -ef
# and extract these values.
# Since we need to set the current shell environment, we must source
# this script.

# usage: . x

# on Jessie we have:
# root      3008  3007  0 12:38 tty2     00:00:01 /usr/bin/X :7 -auth /tmp/serverauth.YPgDh8JPcm
# on Stretch we see (with nodm):
# root      2512  2503  0 17:17 tty7     00:00:04 /usr/lib/xorg/Xorg :0 -nolisten tcp vt7
