ABE Firmware Generation Tool
=============================

This is a tool that allows users to generate new firmware files for the OMAP4+
ABE sound drivers. It's intended to be used to generate the generic bespoke
objects like the firmware text and firmware task configuration.


Build Instructions
==================

After checking out from git :-

./autogen.sh
./configure --with-linux-dir=/path/to/linux.git --with-hal-dir=/path/to/audio-test.git/hal/dir
make
sudo make install

This will install the binary and plugins.

This tool currently requires both th kernel ABE sources and the audio-test.git
HAL sources. It's intended to reduce duplication between the kernel AESS and
audio-test.git HAL sources and try and remove non kernel sources if possible.
It may even be best to merge them in here locally.


Usage Instructions
==================

Use the script abe-toopl.sh in the scripts directory to generate the data files.

i.e. abe-tool.sh 009590

Will generate FW text and data files for version 009590
