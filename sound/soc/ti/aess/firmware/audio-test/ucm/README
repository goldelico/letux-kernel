About UCM
=========

The Alsa Use Case Manager abstracts the numerous mixer controls required by
sound drivers to configure audio routing, manage volume levels and differentiate
PCM sink and source devices. In other words, UCM hides all this complexity
and bespoke sound card knowledge from applications and provides a platform
independant method for audio device configuration.

UCM can manage multiple sound cards per device by combining all the system
audio devices into a compound audio device made up of all the audio devices.
i.e. UCM would manage Bluetooth, HDMI, USB and the device main audio driver as
one compound virtual sound card.

UCM is part of the main ALSA userspace library (alsa-lib).


UCM Configuration Files
=======================

UCM uses configuration files to configure audio use case configurations for
each supported device. The configuration files should be stored under the
directory.

/usr/share/alsa/ucm/CARD_NAME/

Where CARD_NAME is the name of the primary sound card driver for the device.

UCM uses two different types of configuration file :-

1) Master Configuration.
   This file has the same name as the primary sound card. So for SDP4430 it
   will is called SDP4430.conf. This files tells UCM about the high level
   supported use cases for the device and it identifies each use case with a
   separate use case specific configuration file.

2) Use Case Configurations
   Use Case Configuration files contain sequences of mixer control settings
   that are used to manage transitions between use cases (like phone call and
   hifi), devices (like headset and Handset) and modifiers (like Play a ring
   tone and capturing a voice call).


UCM Command Line Tools
======================

UCM has a command line tool called alsaucm that ships with the alsa-utils
package. This tool can be used to manually change the use case, device and
modifier.

Some example alsaucm commands :-

  alsaucm -c CARD set _verb HiFi

Will change the use to to HiFi

  alsaucm -c CARD set _verb HiFi set _enadev Earphone

Will change the use case to HiFi and enable the Earphone device audio path.

  alsaucm -c CARD set _verb HiFi set _enadev Earphone set _swdev/Earphone Headset

Will do the above and additionally switch the device to Headset from Earphone.

There are many commands supported by alsaucm. Further command detials can be
found in the alsa UCM header /usr/include/alsa/use-case.h. There is also an
interactive command line mode that can be enabled by running "alsaucm -i".

Finally there are some simple canned UCM tools in this repository. They
basically wrap UCM command to aid with testing Panda and SDP4430.
