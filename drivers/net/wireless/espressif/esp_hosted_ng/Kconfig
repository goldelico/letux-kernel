	  Add support for the Espressif 802.11 b/g/n SoC.
	  This provides Wi-FI over an SDIO or SPI interface, and
	  is usually found in IoT devices.

	  This module only support IEEE 802.11n WiFi.

	help
	  This module adds support for the SDIO interface of adapters using
	  ESP32 chipset. The ESP32 SDIO is a full speed interface.
	  It meets SDIO card specification version 2.0. The interface supports
	  the 1-bit/4-bit SD transfer mode at the clock range of 0-50 MHz.
	  The host can use this interface to read and write from any register
	  within the chip as well as configure the ESP32 for data DMA.
	  Select this if your platform is using the SDIO bus.

	help
	  This module adds support for the SPI interface of adapters using
	  ESP32 chipset. The ESP32 SDIO has a Serial Peripheral
	  Interface (SPI) that operates as a SPI slave. This SPI interface can
	  be used for control and for serial I/O of 802.11 data.
	  Select this if your platform is using the SPI bus.
