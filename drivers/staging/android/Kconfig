config ANDROID_VSOC
	tristate "Android Virtual SoC support"
	depends on PCI_MSI
	help
	  This option adds support for the Virtual SoC driver needed to boot
	  a 'cuttlefish' Android image inside QEmu. The driver interacts with
	  a QEmu ivshmem device. If built as a module, it will be called vsoc.

config ANDROID_LOGGER
	tristate "Android log driver"
	default n
	---help---
	  This adds support for system-wide logging using four log buffers.

	  These are:

	      1: main
	      2: events
	      3: radio
	      4: system

	  Log reading and writing is performed via normal Linux reads and
	  optimized writes. This optimization avoids logging having too
	  much overhead in the system.

config ANDROID_TIMED_OUTPUT
	bool "Timed output class driver"
	default y

config ANDROID_TIMED_GPIO
	tristate "Android timed gpio driver"
	depends on GPIOLIB || COMPILE_TEST
	depends on ANDROID_TIMED_OUTPUT
	default n
        ---help---
	  Unlike generic gpio is to allow programs to access and manipulate gpio
	  registers from user space, timed output/gpio is a system to allow changing
	  a gpio pin and restore it automatically after a specified timeout.

config ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER
	bool "Android Low Memory Killer"
	---help---
	  Registers processes to be killed when low memory conditions, this is useful
	  as there is no particular swap space on android.

	  The registered process will kill according to the priorities in android init
	  scripts (/init.rc), and it defines priority values with minimum free memory size
	  for each priority.

config ANDROID_INTF_ALARM_DEV
	tristate "Android alarm driver"
	depends on RTC_CLASS
	default n
	---help---
	  Provides non-wakeup and rtc backed wakeup alarms based on rtc or
	  elapsed realtime, and a non-wakeup alarm on the monotonic clock.
	  Also exports the alarm interface to user-space.

config ASHMEM
	bool "Enable the Anonymous Shared Memory Subsystem"
	depends on SHMEM
	help
	  The ashmem subsystem is a new shared memory allocator, similar to
	  POSIX SHM but with different behavior and sporting a simpler
	  file-based API.

	  It is, in theory, a good memory allocator for low-memory devices,
	  because it can discard shared memory units when under memory pressure.
