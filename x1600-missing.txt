x1600 Issues
============

1. UARTs need to be all enabled in DTS
8. spi - if DMA is disabled
12. pwm
13. aic / i2s
15. sadc
16. dtrng
17. can
18. cdbus
19. aes
20. hash
21. mac
22. sfc
23. mcu (the XBurst0 core provided by the DMA controller)
24. efuse
25. cim
26. dpu
27. spi_dev

Most things are missing drivers or bad DTS

Fixed/Notes
===========

2. TCU: "Set X1600-specific clock event flag." - FIXME: should be activated only for x1600
3. OST/TCU/console log timestamps working
4. gpio-keys now working
5. /proc/interrupts now shows two interrupts per press-release cycle for gpio-keys
6. power-controller added and working
7. RTC driver available
6&7. reboot not working (but poweroff)
8. SPI is working - FIXME: if DMA is disabled
9. usb/otg + phy now working
10. shadow gpio registers now  working
11. watchdog
14. i2c - tested without DMA which is not supported in the current driver
