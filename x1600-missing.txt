x1600 Issues
============

1. UARTs need to be all enabled in DTS
6&7. reboot not working (but poweroff)
8. spi - if DMA is disabled
11. watchdog
12. pwm
13. aic / i2s
14. i2c
15. sadc
16. dtrng
17. can
18. cdbus
19. aes
20. hash
21. mac
22. sfc
23. mcu (what is this?)
24. efuse
25. cim
26. dpu

Most things are missing drivers or bad DTS
